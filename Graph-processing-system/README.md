# Graph Processing System

This project is a visual, interactive Java application for learning and demonstrating graph algorithms. It features a user-friendly GUI designed for beginners and is ideal for school presentations.

## Features
- Visualize and run classic graph algorithms: **BFS**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra**, and **PageRank**
- Choose from multiple sample graphs and a maze for testing
- Step-by-step animation with adjustable speed
- Clear instructions, tooltips, and algorithm descriptions in the interface
- Beginner-friendly layout and controls

## How to Use
1. **Select a Graph:** Use the "Graph" dropdown to choose a sample graph or maze.
2. **Select an Algorithm:** Use the "Algorithm" dropdown to pick BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, or PageRank.
3. **Read the Description:** The right panel displays a description of the selected algorithm.
4. **Start the Simulation:** Click **Start** to animate the algorithm step by step.
5. **Pause/Reset:** Use **Pause** to stop the animation and **Reset** to restart with the current settings.
6. **Adjust Speed:** Use the slider to slow down or speed up the animation for better understanding.

## Algorithm Descriptions
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Explores the graph level by level, useful for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs.
- **DFS (Depth-First Search):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Useful for pathfinding and maze solving.
- **Dijkstra:** Finds the shortest path from a starting vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
- **PageRank:** Measures the importance of each node in a graph, originally used by Google Search.

## GUI Overview
- **Instructions:** Shown at the bottom of the window for quick reference.
- **Tooltips:** Hover over buttons and controls for helpful hints.
- **Algorithm Description:** Always visible on the right for the selected algorithm.
- **Graph Visualization:** Nodes and edges are clearly displayed and update as the algorithm runs.

## Folder Structure

- `src/` — Java source code
- `lib/` — Dependencies
- `bin/` — Compiled output

## Getting Started

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Build and run the application (see your Java extension documentation if needed).
3. The GUI will launch and you can begin exploring graph algorithms interactively.
